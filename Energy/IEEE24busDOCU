IEEE 24 bus Description (https://icseg.iti.illinois.edu/ieee-24-bus-system/)
This dataset provides a time-variant view of the IEEE 24-bus system for analyzing hourly changes in power system parameters. 
It is structured to analyze hourly variations in power system parameters at each bus. 
The document provides an overview of the variables used in the 24-hour time horizon dataset. 

Variables and Descriptions

Time (h):

The hour of the day for the data point, ranging from 1 to 24.


Bus ID:

The unique identifier for each bus in the IEEE 24-bus system (1-24)


Active Load (MW):

The active power demand at the bus for the given hour in MW.


Reactive Load (MVAr):

The reactive power demand at the bus for the given hour in MVAr.


Renewable Gen (MW):

The active power generated by renewable energy sources (e.g., wind or solar) connected to the bus in MW.


Voltage (pu):

The voltage magnitude at the bus for the given hour, normalized to the nominal voltage (per unit)

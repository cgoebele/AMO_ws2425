# ðŸ“Š Final Project - Applied Mathematical Optimization

Welcome to the repository for our **Applied Mathematical Optimization** final project! This repository serves as a central hub for all the resources, code, and documentation related to our project.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply mathematical optimization techniques to solve a real-world problem in the Energy Industry:
We look at a network where wind generation is geographically distant from demand and no full interconnection between all busses exist, leading to congestion issues.
Starting from this network setup we aim to evaluate the social gains from implementing pv and local energy storage systems in regards to balancing the stochastic nature of renewables production and preventing possible congestion issues. 

The network setup was chosen to distantly resemble possible problems found in the german energy network: With the general movement towards renewable energy sources and larger wind production in the north with less renewable sources installed in the south where demand sources are difficult to be met by renewable sources in large parts.
Our idea to tackle this problem in a mini-network resembling similar congestion issues is to encourage installation of pv systems on busses distant to the main existing renewable energy source. Installing different pv capacities and supporting this setup with local energy storage systems allows uns to evaluate costs benefits on a macro level which can give valuable insight to regulators and lawmakers regarding possible subsidization or other support systems.
